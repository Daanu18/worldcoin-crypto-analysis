# Worldcoin Crypto Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a detailed system for analyzing Worldcoin cryptocurrency prices using real-time and historical data. The system is designed to collect, process, and visualize market data, including:

- Live price data from Binance API
- Historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Trading volume analysis
- Market trends and volatility visualization
- Automated error handling for API requests

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Fetching**: Uses the `ccxt` library to fetch Worldcoin data from Binance every 15 minutes.
- **OHLCV Data Processing**: Retrieves Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) data for analysis.
- **CSV Data Storage**: Saves historical data to `crypto_data.csv` and appends new data dynamically.
- **Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` for plotting price trends and market movements.
- **Timeframe Selection**: Allows users to choose different timeframes (e.g., 15-minute intervals).
- **Rate-Limited API Requests**: Ensures API requests adhere to Binanceâ€™s rate limits to prevent restrictions.
- **Trigger Function for Automated Execution**: A function that activates when the closing price of Worldcoin exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., $2.5), printing a message and continuing execution.
- **Error Handling & Exception Catching**: Implements a robust mechanism to catch errors and retry failed API requests.

## Graphs

The script generates the following visualizations:

- **Close Price Over Time**: A line graph showing the closing price of Worldcoin over time.
- **Volume Over Time**: A bar chart showing the trading volume of Worldcoin over time.
- **High vs Low Prices**: A line graph comparing the high and low prices of Worldcoin.
- **Close Price with Moving Average**: A line graph showing the closing price along with its 20-period moving average.
